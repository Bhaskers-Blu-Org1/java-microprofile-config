    <h1>Welcome to the MicroProfile Config demonstrator application</h1>
    <p>Please see below for some information on each of the technologies used in this application.</p>
    <div id="technologies">
      <h2>MicroProfile Config</h2>
      <p>
        Inside the project there is an application.rest package containing the
        <code>ConfigRestEndpoint</code>
        class. This adds a REST endpoint which you can access at <a
          href="rest/config">rest/config</a>. It will return a JSON representation
          of all of the available configuration properties. An individual configuration property
          can be accessed by adding the property name at the end of the URL. For example
          <a href="rest/config/java.home">rest/config/java.home</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project also includes an application.configsource package containing the
        <code>TimeConfigSource</code>
        class. This class is a 
        <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/config/spi/ConfigSource.java">
        ConfigSource</a> implementation which returns the current time under the property name
        time.now.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project also includes an application.converter package containing the
        <code>PatternConverter</code> and <code>ResourceBundleConverter</code>
        classes. These classes is are
        <a href="https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/blob/master/api/src/main/java/org/eclipse/microprofile/config/spi/Converter.java">
        Converter</a> implementations which convert property values from type String to the type
        supported by the converter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, the application.rest package contains the
        <code>LibertyRestEndpoint</code>
        class. This adds a REST endpoint which you can access at <a
          href="rest">rest</a>. This class demonstrates using dependency injection to
          receive configuration properties as well as conversion through the Converter implementations
          as well as using javax.inject.Provider to get dynamic property values like time.now.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also a test classes named
        <code>it.config.ConfigRestEndpointTest</code> and <code>it.rest.LibertyRestEndpointTest</code>
        that will test the REST endpoints to ensure they is working.
      </p>
